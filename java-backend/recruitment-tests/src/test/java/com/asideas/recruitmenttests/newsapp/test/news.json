 "shortDescription":"An increasing number of Germans have expressed anxiety about the number of refugees entering the country, according to a new survey. Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel has called for an open discussion of people's fears. ",
 "text":" A poll conducted on behalf of public broadcaster ARD and several German newspapers found a change in German attitudes towards the refugee crisis, with a rise in the number of people afraid that too many refugees are entering the country. 
          An ARD-DeutschlandTrend survey carried out at the end of September found that 51 percent were worried, compared with 38 percent a month earlier. Meanwhile there was a decline in the number saying they were not concerned, from 59 percent to 47 percent.
          The poll showed regional differences, with 59 percent of those in the former East German states expressing anxiety, compared with 48 percent in the former West.
          Pollsters also found a rise in skepticism over immigration in general, with 44 percent of participants now saying that immigration brought with it more disadvantages than advantages. Previously 33 percent held such a view, according to the survey.",
