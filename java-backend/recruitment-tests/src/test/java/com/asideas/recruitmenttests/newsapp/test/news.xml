		Fresh insight into the trove of documents released by NSA 
		whistleblower Edward Snowden has revealed that US spies intercepted
		sensitive communications between Germany's security agencies during a 
		kidnapping in Yemen.

		The kidnappers came in an SUV. Not far from the northern Yemeni city 
		of Saada, they ambushed a party of picnickers and captured a German 
		married couple, their three children and four others. That was on 
		June 12, 2009. The Christian aid workers from Bautzen, Germany, were 
		considered missing for five years, with their deaths only confirmed 
		in August 2014. The kidnappers' identities --and it remains unresolved 
		#whether they were apolitical criminals or Islamists -- remains 
		unclear. The abduction in northern Yemen caused a frenzy of activity 
		in Berlin and in the Yemeni capital. Crisis committees were formed at 
		the German Embassy in Yemen and the Foreign Ministry in Berlin. 
		Diplomats and experts from Germany's Federal Criminal Police Office 
		(BKA) and its foreign intelligence agency, the Bundesnachrichtendienst 
		(BND), frantically tried to obtain background information and establish 
		contact with the kidnappers. Bad news, however, was soon to follow. 
		Three of the German couple's companions -- two German nurses and a 
		South Korean teacher -- were found shot to death several days after 
		their abduction. At the time, German government officials were not the
		only ones interested in the case. New documents from the archive of 
		the former American intelligence employee Edward Snowden, which have 
		been viewed by SPIEGEL, contain evidence that the National Security 
		Agency (NSA) snooped on German agencies' communications concerning the 
		kidnapping. The eavesdropping went all the way up to the BND and 
		provided the Americans with insight into the findings of the German 
		intelligence apparatus.
