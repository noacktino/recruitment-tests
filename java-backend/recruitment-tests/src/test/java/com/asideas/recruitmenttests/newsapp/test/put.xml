	<text>Law enforcement officials have identified the man suspected of 
	opening fire at a community college in Oregon as Chris Harper Mercer, and 
	said he had three weapons, at least one of them a long gun and the other 
	ones handguns. It was not clear whether he fired them all, local media 
	said. The officials said the man lived in the Roseburg area, the New York 
	Times reported. Police said the shooter was killed in an exchange of fire 
	with police. They said one witness told them that he asked about people’s 
	religions before he began firing. He appears to be an angry young man who 
	was very filled with hate,” one law enforcement official said. The 
	26-year-old demanded that his victims lay on the ground and then made 
	them stand up one at a time and state their religion before opening fire 
	according to one traumatised eyewitness. Kortney Moore said she was in her 
	writing class when a bullet went through the window hitting her teacher in 
	the head. Soon after, the shooter was inside the room demanding to know the 
	religion of her fellow students.</text>
