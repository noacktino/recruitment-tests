/**
 * This package represents the main package of the news application containing 
 * the application class. The news application follows a RESTful approach and
 * uses Jersey as JAX-RS reference implementation.
 * 
 *  @see NewsApplicaiton
 *  
 *  Additionally, the application provides both JSON and XML formats. To switch
 *  between both formats it's possible to change the ACCEPT header or to use
 *  the 'dot-notation' e.g. .json + .xml.
